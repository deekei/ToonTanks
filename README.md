# ToonTanks

This Unreal Game Project was originally a Tutorial Project from the Gamedev.tv's "Unreal 5.0 C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games" Course.

Specifically Section 5 "Toon Tanks" Tutorial.

Besides the intiial build based on the project, I have further implemented my own designs to understand and explore different parts of the Unreal Engine C++ System as well as the Blueprints.

Below are some of the implementations I have made beyond the original tutorial:

- Added a Main Game Loop (Start Game-> Main Menu -> Play Game -> Restart GAme -> Quit Game)
- Added a Dash Functionality
- Added Recovery Objects in game
- Added Additional UIs

And other miscellaneous features/

The main objective of this project is to show my understanding of the C++, Unreal Blueprints and simple Game Design development skills, and this project is a pure educational endeavour.

To Play:

The current build is for Windows Machines only. The Executable file is in the "\Build\Windows\ToonTanks\Binaries\Win64" directory.
